# 📝 To-Do List (Console App in Python)

A simple **console-based To-Do List application** built using Python.  
This project helps beginners understand how to use **lists, functions, loops, and user input** in Python.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Add new tasks
- Remove existing tasks
- View current task list
- Exit the program safely
- User-friendly console interaction

---

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- Python Lists
- `append()` and `remove()`
- Functions
- `while` loop
- Conditional statements (`if / elif / else`)
- String methods (`lower()`, `strip()`)

---

## ▶️ How It Works
1. The program asks the user to choose:
   - `add` → add a new task  
   - `remove` → remove an existing task  
   - `exit` → exit the program
2. Tasks are stored in a list.
3. The loop continues until the user types `exit`.

---

## 💻 How to Run
```bash
python todo.py
📌 Sample Output
add/remove/exit: add
what task you want to add: study python
new tasks list: ['study python']
